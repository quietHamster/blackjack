1) Purpose of the Game

	- The object of blackjack is "to beat the dealer".
	- To beat the dealer the player must:
		+ First: not bust (go over 21)
		+ Second: either outscore the dealer or have the dealer bust. 
		
2) Blackjack may be played with one to eight decks of 52-card decks. 

	In this simulation, there are 8 decks of cards
	
3) Aces may be counted as 1 or 11 points, 2 to 9 according to face value, 

	and tens and face cards count as ten points

4) The value of a hand is the sum of the point values of the individual cards. 

	Except, a "blackjack" is the highest hand, consisting of an ace and any 10-point card, 
	and it outranks all other 21-point hands.

5) After the players have bet, the dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to himself. 

	One of the dealer cards is dealt face up. The face-down card is called the "hole card."

6) If the dealer has an ace showing, he will offer a side bet called "insurance." 

	This side wager pays 2 to 1 if the dealer's hole card is any 10-point card. 
	Insurance wagers are optional and may not exceed half the original wager.
